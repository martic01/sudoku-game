## Description

* _The Sudoku Game is a web-based implementation of the classic puzzle game Sudoku. The application allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels, check their answers, and receive feedback on their input.
The game features a clean, intuitive interface that allows players to easily navigate the grid and interact with the puzzle elements. Users can select empty cells, input numbers, and receive immediate feedback on their entries. With a focus on enhancing user experience, the game also includes a variety of helpful features:_

#### Dynamic Puzzle Generation: Each time players start a new game, a unique Sudoku puzzle is generated, ensuring endless gameplay and preventing repetition. The difficulty level can be adjusted to accommodate both novice and seasoned players, allowing them to choose the challenge that best fits their skill level.

#### Real-time Input Validation: The application actively monitors user inputs, providing instant feedback on the correctness of entries. Players are alerted to any invalid numbers, helping them learn the rules of Sudoku while playing. This interactive validation system encourages players to think critically about their choices.

#### Visual Cues and Highlights: To improve the gameplay experience, prefilled cells are visually distinguished from user-modified cells. Incorrect inputs are highlighted in red, while correct ones are indicated with a soft green background. This visual feedback helps players quickly identify and correct mistakes.

#### Solution and Hints: When players find themselves stuck, the game offers a "Solve" feature that reveals the correct answers for the entire grid, allowing users to learn from their errors and understand the logic behind Sudoku solutions. Additionally, hints can be provided for specific cells, guiding players toward valid entries without giving away the entire solution.

#### User-Friendly Interface: The design prioritizes ease of use, featuring large buttons for number inputs and a clear layout that enhances navigation. Players can easily clear their inputs, start a new game, or view results with simple clicks.

#### Engagement and Learning: Beyond just a game, the Sudoku application serves as a tool for cognitive development. Players improve their logical reasoning and problem-solving skills as they work to complete the puzzles, making it a beneficial exercise for users of all ages.

* Overall, the Sudoku Game is designed to provide both entertainment and mental stimulation, making it a perfect choice for anyone looking to enjoy a classic puzzle experience while sharpening their skills.
